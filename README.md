Smart Campus is an initiative to use ICT (Information and Communication Technology) within a University Campus to improve the quality and performance of the services, to reduce costs and resource consumption, and to engage more effectively and actively with its members. The defining technologies that have brought Smart Campus concept to the forefront are IoT (Internet of Things) and Cloud computing. The drive towards a smarter campus (& its extension towards smart cities) is inevitable. 


This project will be a pilot project to be at the forefront of this change in our University. In phase 1 of Smart Campus (i.e., this project) we will implement a Sensor Network/IoT based Smart Parking System to map the usage of parking spaces within the University (starting with the Engineering Faculty).
